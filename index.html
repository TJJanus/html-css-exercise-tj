    <p>Hello. I’m <span class='bold'>Dr. Richard Gerhauser.</span></p>
    <p>I’d like to ask you a question. And I apologize if it’s a bit <span class='bold'>personal…</span></p>
    <p class='bold-p'>How are you sleeping these days?</p>
    <p>Meaning, when was the last time you woke up in the morning feeling truly… <br><span class='bold'>re-freshed?</span></p>
    <p>Like your batteries were <span class='bold'>completely recharged?</span></p>
    <p>And when’s the last time you sat up in bed, bright-eyed and <span class='bold'>bursting with <br> en-ergy…</span></p>
    <p>…like waking up on the <span class='bold'>first day of summer vacation </span> when you were a kid?</p>
    <p><span class ='bold'>How long since you’ve had that feeling?</span></p>
    <p>Has it been a while? <span class='italic'>A decade—or even more?</span></p>
    <p>Well, despite what you may think… <span class='bold'>it’s not your fault.</span></p>
    <p><span class='bold'>I’m here to show you my scientifically verified way to reclaim that restful sleep </span></p>

        <p class='span-2'>(night after night)…</p>
        <p>AND boundless energy (day after day)…</p>
        <p>In fact, with what I’m about to show you… <span class=italic>just days from now…</span></p>
        <p class='boldd'>You could start enjoying a full 84 minutes MORE deep, restful sleep <span class='underline'>everynight</span>.</p>
        <p>The fact is: If you’re like most of my patients over the age of 50…</p>
        <p>You’re not getting even <span class='underline'>close</span> to the hours of quality sleep you used to.</p>
        <p>You go to bed, <span class='boldd'>but you can’t fall asleep.</span></p>
        <p>Your mind keeps churning and nagging worries creep in… making it tough to <br>drift off.</p>
        <p>And, when you do fall asleep, <span class='boldd'>you can’t STAY asleep.</span></p>
        <p>Inevitably, you wake up… <span class='boldd'>wide awake</span></p>
        <p>Like your body is saying it’s time to get up. <span class='boldd'>But it’s not…</span></p>
        <p>It’s still  <span class='boldd'>the middle of the night.</span></p>
        <p>Dawn is hours away… you feel drained, <span class='boldd'>but you can’t fall back asleep</span>… Or </p>
        <p>sometimes it’s your <span class='boldd'>bladder</span>… or frustrating <span class='boldd'>aches</span> and <span class='boldd'>pains</span>… <span class='italic'>that wake you up</span>… make you toss and turn…</p>
        <p>And then it’s nearly  <span class='boldd'>impossible to get back to sleep</span>…</p>
        <p>Whether it’s one of these problems or <span class='bold-p'>all of them…</span> the results are the same.</p>
        <p>Every morning you feel drowsy, red-eyed… <span class='bold'>just plain exhausted.</span></p>
        <p>Sound all too familiar?</p>
        <p>As a doctor, I can assure you – what you’re experiencing isn’t something “you just have to live with at your age”…</p>
        <p>Because if you watch this presentation and try my method… we’ll finally be able to fix your sleep problems—FOR GOOD.</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd heading-2'>It all happens by resetting your sleep cycle, <br>then your new, healthy sleep will be on auto-pilot</p>
        <p>You see, when you don’t sleep well—even for just one night—<span class='boldd'>your body and brain</span> aren’t able to “recharge”…</p>
        <p>So you <span class='boldd'>barely</span> have the energy to get through your daily routine, much less do the fun, social activities you used to enjoy…</p>
        <p>Sure, you might be able to squeak by that way… but, be honest, does it feel good?</p>
        <p>Or even normal?</p>
        <p>Maybe you’ve even tried sleep aids before – and found they don’t really work?</p>
        <p>I’m not surprised.</p>
        <p>They never actually get to the <span class='italic'>root</span> of your problems… so they’re a complete waste of money.</p>
        <p>Here’s the truth I’ve been telling my senior patients for more than 20 years now:</p>
        <p>The reason sleep aids don’t work is because…</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd'>There are 3 separate issues affecting seniors</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd'>and making it near impossible for you to get deep “recharging” sleep…</p>
        <p>I call them the <span class='boldd'>3 Sleep Stealers</span>.</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd heading-2'>The 3 Sleep Stealers</p>
        <p>Before we get started, let’s identify how many you might have now…</p>

    
        <p>Sleep Stealer #1: <span class='boldd'>When you go to bed, does your “racing” mind keep you from falling asleep quickly?</span></p>
        <p>I know that feeling too, and I’m about to show you a special technique that works like a “light dimmer” to gently calm your brain and help you fall asleep in HALF the time.
        <p>Sleep Stealer #2: <span class='boldd'>Has your body STOPPED “making sleep”?</span></p>
        <p>That may sound a little weird, but keep watching and I’ll show you a quick way to check.</p>
        <p>After all, if you often find yourself <span class='boldd'>awake during the night</span>…</p>
        <p>Or <span class='boldd'>wake up far too early</span> in the morning…</p>
        <p>Then your body may have stopped “making sleep.”</p>
        <p>It happens to a lot of people as they get older.</p>
        <p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to fix it. I’ll explain everything in a moment.</p>
        <p>But first…</p>
        <p>Sleep Stealer #3: <span class='boldd'>Do you have any nighttime annoyances</span>, like getting up to pee or pain that keeps you awake?</p>
        <p>This is the BIGGEST complaint I hear from my patients, but luckily the solution to keeping the pesky wake-up calls at bay is so simple…</p>
        <p>Maybe <span class='underline boldd'>all 3</span> of these “Sleep Stealers” sound familiar?</p>
        <p>These issues are the real reason why you have such trouble sleeping…</p>
        <p>And that’s what makes my solution different than anything else you might’ve tried before.</p>
        <p>I’m about to share with you the same thing I tell my patients…</p>
        <p>We can <span class='boldd'>solve your sleep problem together</span>.</p>

        <p><span class='underline boldd'>Right now</span>… <span class='boldd'>for the first time ever,</span></p>

        <p class='boldd'>I’m giving you my method to defeat all 3 Sleep Stealers…</p>
        <p class='italic'>Right here in this presentation.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is <span class='underline'>naturally</span> <span class='boldd'>“reset your sleep cycle</span>”…</p>
        <p>And if you follow the few steps I’m about to show you… it’ll be like trading in your <span class='italic'>current frustrating, unsatisfying</span> sleep…</p>
        <p>For the <span class='boldd'>deep, restful sleep</span> you remember from your teenage years.</p>
        <p>That’s not a promise, it’s a <span class='boldd'>GUARANTEE</span>.</p>
        <p>Let me explain.</p>
        <p>I’m talking about a new, non-drug solution for your sleep problems.</p>
        <p>Just do the 3 simple steps in this video and I guarantee you will…</p>
        <p>Fall asleep in <span class='underline boldd'>half</span> the time…</p>
        <p>Spend <span class='underline'>more hours every night</span> in restful REM or “<span class='boldd'>deep sleep</span>”…</p>
        <p><span class='boldd'>And dramatically decrease</span> how often you wake up overnight to use the restroom or because of aches and pains…</p>
        <p>In fact, these 3 simple steps are so powerful, they’re…<br>…scientifically verified to give <span class='boldd'>an EXTRA</span> <span class ='underline boldd'>84 minutes of sleep</span> every night. </p>
        <p>Let me repeat that… follow these 3 scientifically verified steps…</p>
        <p>And you’ll enjoy almost <span class='boldd'>an hour and a half MORE sleep every single night</span>. </p>
        <p>That’s like <span class='boldd'>10 BONUS hours of deep, restful sleep every week</span>…</p>
        <p>Friend, if you’re struggling with one, two, or all three of the “Sleep Stealers”… <br>THIS is a life-saver.</p>
        <p>The truth is,</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd'>I see almost no bigger change in quality of life and health for seniors than when they follow my 3-step protocol and reset their sleep cycle</p>
        <p>And when you do it yourself… pretty soon, you’ll have your own moment. </p>
        <p>Picture this…</p>
        <p>You’re getting ready for bed.</p>
        <p>You slip under the blankets, switch off the light… and close your eyes.</p>
        <p><span class='boldd'>Your mind is calm.</span> You’re not worried or anxious…</p>
        <p>You feel at peace.</p>
        <p>In just a few minutes you drift off to sleep… <span class='italic'>without a care in the world</span>…</p>
        <p>Then… before you know it… <span class='boldd'>you open your eyes</span>.</p>
        <p>You blink in the morning sun streaming through your windows.</p>
        <p>You suddenly realize: <span class='boldd'>You slept straight through the night</span>.</p>
        <p>You didn’t get up to use the restroom… you didn’t wake up because of aching joints or a sore back…</p>
        <p>In fact,</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd'>You just experienced the deepest, most refreshing night’s sleep you can remember…</p>
        <p>So you swing your legs over the side of the bed… <span class='boldd'>eager to start your day</span>.</p>
        <p><span class='boldd'>You’re full of energy.</span> Your mind is <span class='underline'>crystal clear</span>.</p>
        <p>Heck, you might just skip your usual morning coffee and plunge right into your day.</p>
        <p>You can’t believe how great… <span class='boldd'>how YOUNG</span>… you feel.</p>
        <p>Just imagine if you felt that way <span class='underline'>every morning</span> from now on.</p>
        <p class='boldd'>You can.</p>
        <p>And I <span class='italic'>guarantee it</span>.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is “reset your sleep cycle” in 3 easy steps…</p>
        <p>So let’s get started right now.</p>
        <p>And don’t worry about memorizing this or taking notes. At the end of this presen-tation I’ll make the full protocol available for you…</p>


        <p>Ok, let’s jump right in with <span class='boldd'>Step 1</span>:</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd'>How to get 10 EXTRA hours of sleep every week thanks to my best sleep secret:</p>
        <p class='center-p boldd underline'>An Ancient Roman cherry</p>
        <p>It’s shown to give you <span class='boldd'>an extra 84 minutes of deep, restful sleep every night</span>.</p>
        <p>Ever heard of the <span class='boldd'>Roman Dream Cherry?</span></p>
        <p>Here’s a picture.</p>

        <div class='cherry-container'>
            <img class='cherry' src='./cherries.jpg' alt='cherries'>
            <p>They look a lot like the “normal” cherries we’re used to seeing in the supermar-ket, don’t they?</p>
        </div>

        <p>Actually, what you’re seeing is a very <span class='boldd'>rare and special kind of cherry</span>.</p>
        <p>It’s an <span class='boldd'>exotic fruit</span> that goes all the way back to ancient Rome.</p>
        <p>And science has FINALLY caught on… the ancient Dream Cherry is a <span class='boldd'>God-send for seniors</span> who have trouble sleeping…</p>
        <p>Just listen to this: Recently, a study was conducted on a small group of <span class='boldd'>seniors with serious sleeping challenges…</span></p>
        <p>Some of the volunteers drank a cup of <span class='boldd'>Dream Cherry</span> juice every day…</p>
        <p>The rest of the volunteers were given a <span class='boldd'>placebo</span>.</p>
        <p><span class='boldd'>After just 14 days</span>, all of the volunteers were tested using something called a polysomnographic sleep study. (That’s just a fancy sleep monitoring system.)</p>
        <p>That way, they could <span class='boldd'>accurately</span> test if Dream Cherry helped people sleep bet-ter.</p>
        <p>And when they got the results, the scientists couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
